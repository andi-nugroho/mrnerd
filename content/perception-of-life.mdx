**The level of discipline you need as a man to change your life is just crazy.**

> Discipline is the quiet violence required to rebuild a man.
> There’s no applause. No comfort. Just relentless choices in silence. Every day, the old self begs for ease. You deny him again and again until he dies.
> If it doesn’t feel insane, you’re not doing enough.
> A man changes his life by becoming someone his past couldn’t survive.
